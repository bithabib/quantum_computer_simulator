## All Quantum Gates: 
 - Pauli X Gate (NOT Gate): Flips the state of a qubit from |0⟩ to |1⟩ and vice versa.
 - Pauli Y Gate: Similar to the Pauli X gate but includes a phase flip.
 - Pauli Z Gate: Introduces a phase flip without changing the state of the qubit.
 - Hadamard Gate: Creates a superposition by putting a qubit in an equal probability of |0⟩ and |1⟩ states.
 - CNOT Gate (Controlled-NOT Gate): Performs a NOT operation on the target qubit if the control qubit is |1⟩.
 - SWAP Gate: Swaps the states of two qubits.
 - Toffoli Gate (CCNOT Gate): Performs a NOT operation on the target qubit if both control qubits are |1⟩.
 - Fredkin Gate (CSWAP Gate): Swaps the states of two qubits based on the state of a third qubit.
 - Phase Gate: Introduces a phase shift without changing the state of the qubit.
 - CPhase Gate (Controlled-Phase Gate): Applies a phase shift to the target qubit depending on the state of the control qubit.
 - Rx, Ry, Rz Gates: Rotation gates around the x, y, and z axes, respectively.
 - U Gate (Arbitrary Single-Qubit Gate): Represents a general single-qubit unitary operation.
 - CCZ Gate (Controlled-Controlled-Z Gate): Applies a phase shift to the target qubit if both control qubits are |1⟩.
 - CS Gate (Controlled-S Gate): Applies a phase shift to the target qubit if the control qubit is |1⟩.
 - CRx, CRy, CRz Gates (Controlled-Rotation Gates): Controlled versions of the single-qubit rotation gates.
