# Bloch sphere visualization

This small Javascript tool aims at providing a simple-to-use interface for visualizing quantum state evolutions on the Bloch sphere. The original intend was to replace the tyipical pens that one holds in the hand to follow a trajectory with an online tool that is available on every computer. Furthermore, it proved helpful in the teaching context when introducing students to spin dynamics.
