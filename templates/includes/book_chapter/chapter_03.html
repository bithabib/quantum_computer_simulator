    <p>The probability amplitude is a complex number that represents the probability of finding a qubit in a particular
        state. The probability amplitude is a combination of the amplitude and phase of the qubit state. The amplitude
        is the magnitude of the probability amplitude, and the phase is the angle of the probability amplitude. The
        probability amplitude is used to calculate the probability of measuring a qubit in a particular state. The
        probability of measuring a qubit in a particular state is the square of the magnitude of the probability
        amplitude.</p>
    <h2>Derivation of Probability Formula for Quantum Mechanics</h2>

    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>In quantum mechanics, the probability of a particular outcome is related to the square of the magnitude of the
        probability amplitude. When considering the combination of two probability amplitudes, alpha1 and alpha2, the
        probability formula involves the interference between them.</p>

    <h3>Complex Conjugates</h3>
    <p>In the context of complex numbers, the complex conjugate of a complex number <em>z</em>, denoted as <em>z*</em>
        or <em>âˆš</em>z, is formed by changing the sign of the imaginary part of <em>z</em>.</p>
    <p>If <em>z = a + bi</em> where <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> are real numbers and <em>i</em> is the imaginary unit,
        then the complex conjugate <em>z*</em> is given by:</p>
    <p>$$ z^* = a - bi $$</p>
    <p>In other words, the complex conjugate of a complex number simply reflects the point representing that number
        across the real axis on the complex plane. Geometrically, if you have a point representing a complex number in
        the complex plane, its complex conjugate is the reflection of that point across the real axis.</p>
    <p>The complex conjugate is particularly useful when dealing with operations involving complex numbers, such as
        multiplication, division, and taking the modulus. For example, when multiplying a complex number by its
        conjugate, the imaginary parts cancel out, resulting in a real number:</p>
    <p>$$ z \cdot z^* = (a + bi)(a - bi) = a^2 + b^2 $$</p>
    <p>This property is often used in various mathematical and physical contexts, including quantum mechanics, where
        complex numbers and their conjugates play a crucial role in describing the behavior of quantum systems.</p>



        
    <h3>Probability Amplitude</h3>
    <p>Whole quantum physics can be summarise by three Probability Amplitude rules </p>
    <p>$$ \text{Probability} = |\alpha|^2 $$</p>
    <p>$$ \alpha = \alpha_1 + \alpha_2$$</p>
    <p>$$ \alpha = \alpha_1 * \alpha_2 $$</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Combined Probability Amplitude</h3>
    <p>Let alpha be the combined probability amplitude:</p>
    <p>$$ \alpha = \alpha_1 + \alpha_2 $$</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Probability Calculation</h3>
    <p>The probability of the outcome is given by the square of the magnitude of alpha:</p>
    <p>$$ \text{Probability} = |\alpha|^2 = |\alpha_1 + \alpha_2|^2 $$</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Expansion</h3>
    <p>Expanding the expression using complex conjugates:</p>
    <p>$$ |\alpha_1 + \alpha_2|^2 = (\alpha_1 + \alpha_2) \cdot (\alpha_1^* + \alpha_2^*) $$</p>
    <p>$$ = \alpha_1 \alpha_1^* + \alpha_2 \alpha_2^* + \alpha_1 \alpha_2^* + \alpha_2 \alpha_1^* $$</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Interference Term</h3>
    <p>The interference term alpha1 alpha2* contains the phase difference between alpha1 and alpha2, denoted by phi2 -
        phi1, where phi1 and phi2 are the phases of alpha1 and alpha2 respectively.</p>
    <p>$$ \alpha_1 \alpha_2^* = |\alpha_1||\alpha_2|\cos(\phi_2 - \phi_1) $$</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Final Probability Formula</h3>
    <p>Substituting the interference term back into the expression:</p>
    <p>$$ |\alpha_1 + \alpha_2|^2 = |\alpha_1|^2 + |\alpha_2|^2 + 2|\alpha_1||\alpha_2|\cos(\phi_2 - \phi_1) $$</p>
    <p>This formula accounts for the interference between the probability amplitudes and determines the probability of
        the outcome.</p>
