<h1><b>Third-Polarizing-Filter Experiment Demystified — How It Works</b></h1>

<br><br>

Shine light through two polarizing filters oriented at 90° to each other, and no light gets through. But put a third
filter inbetween them, at 45° to each of the existing filters, and amazingly enough — some lights gets
through!<br><br>

This popular experiment is often described as “strange.” It is usually presented in the context of quantum
mechanics, as an example of the “spookiness” of quantum effects. Rarely, however, does the presenter inform the
audience that this experiment can be explained in very simple terms of cause and effect, without reference to spooky
quantum magic or anything like that.<br><br>

Let’s start by going over the standard experiment:<br><br>

<center><img src="static/polarizer_experiment/01.gif"><br>
    <font size="-1"><b>Figure 1</b></font>
</center><br>

In Figure 1, an unpolarized, parallel light source is fired through a polarizing filter, and the light strongly
registers in a light meter at the other end.<br><br>

    <font size="-1"><b>Figure 2</b></font>
</center><br>

In Figure 2, a second filter is introduced, oriented at 90° to the first one. Now, no light gets through.<br><br>

    <font size="-1"><b>Figure 3</b></font>
</center><br>

In Figure 3, a third filter is placed inbetween the first two, at 45° to each of them. Suddenly, the light meter
registers a significant amount of light, although not as much as in Figure 1. Spooky!<br><br><br>

<strong><i><b>Spookiness and the Word “Filter”</b></i></strong><br><br>

Why do these results seem spooky? The reason is because of the misapplication of the word “filter.” A filter is
commonly understood to mean a device that knocks some items out of a stream, while leaving others essentially
untouched. A good example of a filter is a sieve — it blocks objects of a particular size, while allowing objects of
other sizes to pass through.<br><br>

    <font size="-1"><b>Figure 4</b></font>
</center><br>

Another example would be a color filter that knocks out some frequencies of light while letting others
through.<br><br>

    <font size="-1"><b>Figure 5</b></font>
</center><br>

Understood this way, the results of the polarizer experiment are indeed spooky. If the all-blocking equivalent of
Figure 2 is constructed using sieves or color frequency filters (see Figures 4 and 5), we are certainly confident
that the addition of more filters in the middle of the sequence will not yield different results at the end.<br><br>

But what if our so-called “filters” could not only block components of the stream, but also change them? Then we
would not be surprised at all if the addition of new “filters” in the middle caused items to get through to the end.
If a sieve could not only block particles, but also change their size, or if a color filter could not only block
frequencies, but shift light to a different frequency, then all bets are off.<br><br>

This, in fact, is what a polarizer does.<br><br>

    <font size="-1"><b>Figure 6</b></font>
</center><br>

Look at Figure 6 and ask yourself this question: What percentage of the unpolarized light is oriented to exactly 0°
or very nearly 0°? Almost none of it — certainly less than 1%. So, if a polarizer simply knocked out undesirable
orientations, the strength of the remaining light would be almost entirely gone — it would be less than 1% as strong
as the original light source. But you know a polarizer doesn’t do that, because you can pick up an ordinary pair of
polarizing sunglasses and observe that they’re not even particularly dark! Obviously, something else must be
happening.<br><br>

</center><br>

Let’s see what happens to each of the orientations represented in our simple diagram (from Figure 6):<br><br>

<center><img src="static/polarizer_experiment/08.gif"><br>
    <font size="-1"><b>Figure 8</b></font>
</center><br>

In Figure 8, we see that light already at 0° is unchanged. We knew that already.<br><br>

<center><img src="static/polarizer_experiment/09.gif"><br>
    <font size="-1"><b>Figure 9</b></font>
</center><br>

In Figure 9, we see what happens to light oriented at 45° — it has its transverse (vertical) component destroyed,
and becomes oriented to 0°, but with a weaker magnitude. Simple geometry tells us that it must have a magnitude
about 71% of what it had before being polarized to 0° — i.e., 1/sqrt(2) = .707<br><br>

<center><img src="static/polarizer_experiment/10.gif"><br>
    <font size="-1"><b>Figure 10</b></font>
</center><br>

Figure 10 shows us that light that is close to 0° loses only a little of its magnitude when being crushed to
0°...<br><br>

<center><img src="static/polarizer_experiment/11.gif"><br>
    <font size="-1"><b>Figure 11</b></font>
</center><br>

...while Figure 11 shows us that light that is close to 90° off of the polarizer loses <i>most</i> of its magnitude
when being crushed to 0°.<br><br>

<center><img src="static/polarizer_experiment/12.gif"><br>
    <font size="-1"><b>Figure 12</b></font>
</center><br>

And finally, Figure 12 illustrates light at 90° to the filter being crushed completely out of existence. Figure 12,
in fact, illustrates what is happening in Figure 2 when we had only two polarizers in the path of our light
source.<br><br>

What is happening in Figure 3? With our new understanding of what a polarizer does, it is easy to figure it
out:<br><br>

<center><img src="static/polarizer_experiment/13.gif"><br>
    <font size="-1"><b>Figure 13</b></font>
</center><br>

Figure 13 shows the middle filter taking 0° polarized light (from the first filter) and crushing it to a 45°
orientation. This causes the light to drop to about 71% of its magnitude coming from the first filter.<br><br>

<center><img src="static/polarizer_experiment/14.gif"><br>
    <font size="-1"><b>Figure 14</b></font>
</center><br>

And Figure 14 shows the last filter taking the 45° polarized light (from the middle filter) and crushing it to a 90°
orientation. This causes another 29% drop (0.71x) in magnitude, for an overall drop of exactly 50% (as compared to
the results of the single-filter setup in Figure 1). These results can be verified by performing the experiment with
an actual light meter — the meter should show about twice as strong a reading in the Figure 1 arrangement as it does
in the Figure 3 arrangement.<br><br><br>

So there you have it! No spooky quantum properties. Nothing very mysterious about it, in fact. A straightforward
chain of cause and effect, yielding rational, comprehensible results.<br><br><br>
