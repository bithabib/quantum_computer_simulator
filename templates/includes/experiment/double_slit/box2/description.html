        <h3>Path Difference (Δx):</h3>
        <p>The path difference between two waves reaching a point on the screen from the two slits
            determines whether they interfere constructively or destructively.</p>
        <p>It is given by:</p>
        <p>Δx = d sin(θ)</p>
        <p>where d is the distance between the slits and θ is the angle between the line joining the point
            on the screen and the central axis.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="equation">
        <h3>Condition for Constructive Interference:</h3>
        <p>For constructive interference to occur, the path difference Δx must be an integer multiple of the
            wavelength of the light (λ).</p>
        <p>Mathematically, this condition can be expressed as:</p>
        <p>Δx = mλ</p>
        <p>where m is an integer (0, 1, 2, ...).</p>
    </div>
    <div class="equation">
        <h3>Condition for Destructive Interference:</h3>
        <p>For destructive interference to occur, the path difference Δx must be an odd multiple of half the
            wavelength of the light (λ/2).</p>
        <p>Mathematically, this condition can be expressed as:</p>
        <p>Δx = (2m + 1)λ/2</p>
        <p>where m is an integer (0, 1, 2, ...).</p>

    <div class="equation">
        <h3>Intensity Formula:</h3>
        <p>The intensity \( I \) of light at a point on the screen can be expressed as:</p>
        <p>\( I = I_0 \cos^2(\phi) \)</p>
        <p>Where:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>\( I_0 \) is the maximum intensity, which occurs when both waves are in phase (constructive
                interference).</li>
            <li>\( \phi \) is the phase difference between the two waves reaching that point.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The intensity of light at each point depends on the interference pattern, with bright fringes corresponding
            to constructive interference and dark fringes corresponding to destructive interference.</p>
    </div>


    <div class="equation">
        <h3>Phase Difference Formula:</h3>
        <p>The phase difference \( \phi \) can be related to the path difference \( \Delta x \) using the wave number \(
            k \) (related to the wavelength \( \lambda \)):</p>
        <p>\( \phi = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda} \Delta x \)</p>
        <p>So, the intensity at a point on the screen depends on the path difference \( \Delta x \), which in turn
            depends on the distance from the slits and the angle at which the light reaches that point.</p>
        <p>The brightness of the light at different points on the screen in the double-slit experiment is determined by
            the interference pattern, with bright fringes corresponding to constructive interference and dark fringes
            corresponding to destructive interference.</p>
