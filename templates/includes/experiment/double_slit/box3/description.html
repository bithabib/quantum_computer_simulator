    <h1>The Double-Slit Experiment</h1>
    <p>In a double-slit experiment, a particle (such as a photon) emitted from a source <strong>S</strong> can reach a
        detector <strong>D</strong> by taking two different paths, e.g., through an upper or a lower slit in a barrier
        between the source and the detector. After sufficiently many repetitions of this experiment, we can evaluate the
        frequency of clicks in the detector <strong>D</strong> and show that it is inconsistent with the predictions
        based on probability theory. Let us use the quantum approach to show how the discrepancy arises.</p>

    <p>The particle emitted from <strong>S</strong> can reach detector <strong>D</strong> by taking two different paths,
        which are assigned probability amplitudes <strong>z1</strong> and <strong>z2</strong>, respectively. We may then
        say that the upper slit is taken with probability <strong>p1 = |z1|²</strong> and the lower slit with
        probability <strong>p2 = |z2|²</strong>. These are two mutually exclusive events. With the two slits open,
        allowing the particle to take either path, probability theory declares (by the Kolmogorov additivity axiom) that
        the particle should reach the detector with probability <strong>p1 + p2 = |z1|² + |z2|²</strong>. But this is
        not what happens experimentally!</p>

    <p>That is, if one happens then the other one cannot. For example, "heads" and "tails" are mutually exclusive
        outcomes of flipping a coin, but "heads" and "6" are not mutually exclusive outcomes of simultaneously flipping
        a coin and rolling a dice.</p>

    <p>Let us see what happens if we instead follow the two "quantum rules": first, we add the amplitudes, then we
        square the absolute value of the sum to get the probability. Thus, the particle will reach the detector with
        probability </p>
    <p>\( p = |z|^2 \)</p>
    <p>\( = |z_1 + z_2|^2 \)</p>
    <p>\( = |z_1|^2 + |z_2|^2 + z_1^* z_2 + z_1 z_2^* \)</p>
    <p>\( = p_1 + p_2 + |z_1| \cdot |z_2| (e^{i(\phi_2 - \phi_1)} + e^{-i(\phi_2 - \phi_1)}) \)</p>
    <p>\( = p_1 + p_2 + 2p_1 p_2 \cos(\phi_2 - \phi_1) \)</p>
    <p>The appearance of the interference terms marks the departure from the classical theory of probability. The
        probability of any two seemingly mutually exclusive events is the sum of the probabilities of the individual
        events modified by the interference term. Depending on the relative phase <strong>φ2 - φ1</strong>, the
        interference term can be either negative (destructive interference) or positive (constructive interference),
        leading to either suppression or enhancement, respectively, of the total probability <strong>p</strong>.</p>

    <p>The algebra is simple; our focus is on the physical interpretation. Firstly, note that the important quantity
        here is the relative phase <strong>φ2 - φ1</strong> rather than the individual phases <strong>φ1</strong> and
        <strong>φ2</strong>. This observation implies that the particle reacts only to the difference of the two phases,
        each pertaining to a separate path. Secondly, what has happened to the additivity axiom in probability theory?
        What was wrong with it? One problem is the assumption that the processes of taking the upper or the lower slit
        are mutually exclusive; in reality, as we have just mentioned, the two transitions both occur simultaneously.
    </p>

    <p>According to the philosopher Karl Popper (1902–1994), a theory is genuinely scientific only if it is possible, in
        principle, to establish that it is false. Genuinely scientific theories are never finally confirmed because, no
        matter how many confirming observations have been made, observations that are inconsistent with the empirical
        predictions of the theory are always possible. There is no fundamental reason why Nature should conform to the
        additivity axiom.</p>

    <p>We find out how nature works by making "intelligent" guesses, running experiments, checking what happens, and
        formulating physical theories. If our guess disagrees with experiments, then it is wrong, so we try another
        intelligent guess, and another, etc. Right now, quantum theory is the best guess we have: it offers good
        explanations and predictions that have not been falsified by any of the existing experiments. This said, rest
        assured that one day quantum theory will be falsified, and then we will have to start guessing all over again.
