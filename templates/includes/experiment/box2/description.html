        <h3>Path Difference (Δx):</h3>
        <p>The path difference between two waves reaching a point on the screen from the two slits
            determines whether they interfere constructively or destructively.</p>
        <p>It is given by:</p>
        <p>Δx = d sin(θ)</p>
        <p>where d is the distance between the slits and θ is the angle between the line joining the point
            on the screen and the central axis.</p>

    <div class="equation">
        <h3>Condition for Constructive Interference:</h3>
        <p>For constructive interference to occur, the path difference Δx must be an integer multiple of the
            wavelength of the light (λ).</p>
        <p>Mathematically, this condition can be expressed as:</p>
        <p>Δx = mλ</p>
        <p>where m is an integer (0, 1, 2, ...).</p>

    <div class="equation">
        <h3>Condition for Destructive Interference:</h3>
        <p>For destructive interference to occur, the path difference Δx must be an odd multiple of half the
            wavelength of the light (λ/2).</p>
        <p>Mathematically, this condition can be expressed as:</p>
        <p>Δx = (2m + 1)λ/2</p>
        <p>where m is an integer (0, 1, 2, ...).</p>
