    <p>Double-slit Experiment</p>
    <p>When a beam of light is directed at a screen with two closely spaced slits, an interference pattern is observed. This is a classic example of wave-particle duality. The interference pattern is observed even when the light intensity is reduced to the point where only one photon is passing through the slits at a time. This experiment is a classic example of the principle of superposition.</p>
